Voice-Activated AI Assistant
Overview
This is a voice-activated AI assistant that listens to voice commands, processes them using natural language processing (NLP), and performs tasks accordingly. It is designed to improve productivity by automating tasks such as searching the web, setting reminders, controlling smart devices, and providing real-time information.
Features
Speech Recognition – Converts spoken words into text.
Natural Language Processing (NLP) – Understands and processes voice commands.
Task Automation – Performs various tasks such as opening applications, setting alarms, and retrieving information.
Web Search Integration – Fetches relevant information from the web.
Smart Home Control – Supports integration with IoT devices (optional feature).
Customizable Commands – Users can define their own voice commands.
Text-to-Speech (TTS) – Provides voice responses to user queries.
